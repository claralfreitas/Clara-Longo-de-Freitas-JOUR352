<p class="headline"> How BTS fans created a culture of giving back</p>
<p class="byline"> By Clara Longo de Freitas</p>


<p> The world knows them as BTS. </p>

<p> But the Korean pop music group's full name is Bangtan Sonyeondan, or Bulletproof Boy Scouts. </p>

<p>"‘Bangtan’ means to be resistant to bullets, so it means to block out stereotypes, criticisms, and expectations that aim on adolescents like bullets, to preserve the values and ideal of today’s adolescents,” BTS member J-Hope said once in an interview with Affinity Magazine. </p>

<p> For many fans, "Bangtan Sonyeondan" is especially meaningful at a time where the world is living through systemic racism and a global pandemic. Their discography, their projects, make listeners critically evaluate the education system, Caroline Hirano said. It makes listeners crave for self-love and self-knowledge, using the Carl Jung’s psychological theory as a concept for their album. </p>

<p> “They understand the youth and they give them a voice. Their work changes people, it makes them more confident, more empathetic and better people.” Hirano, who is a university student in Brazil, said. “It is exactly what people need from an artist – an artist the vocalizes issues.” </p>
<p> In early June, Korean pop musical group BTS donated $1 million to Black Lives Matter. Within 24 hours, its fan base – known as ARMY, which stands for “Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth” – matched their donation. </p>

<p> Hirano was one of the ARMYs that donated as part of #MatchAMillion, a trend that sparked on Twitter that called fans to donate to Black Lives Matter.</p>

<p> “I’ve never seen a musical group has so much contact with charity work and political activism as much as BTS and its fans,” Hirano said. </p>

<br>

<p>For those who are part of BTS fandom, charity work is part of the norm. The organization that orchestrated the donation for Black Lives Matter, One In An Army, have organized over 634 fundraisers globally since 2015.</p>
<br>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="ko" dir="ltr">우리는 인종차별에 반대합니다.<br>우리는 폭력에 반대합니다.<br>나, 당신, 우리 모두는 존중받을 권리가 있습니다. 함께 하겠습니다.<br><br>We stand against racial discrimination.<br>We condemn violence.<br>You, I and we all have the right to be respected.

<center><div id="caption">A few days before their donation went public, BTS posted this statement on their Twitter account.</div></center>
<br>
<p> One In An Army started the campaign just a few days before BTS reportedly donated to Black Lives Matter, creating a card that allowed donors to split their donation between multiple organizations. </p>
<p> “We’ve run big projects before, but the amount of support for this project is overwhelming,” A spokesperson said at a press release. “We are so proud that ARMY have once again channeled their power for good and are making a real impact in the fight against anti-black racism.”  </p>

<br>

<p>It all started in March of 2018, when a fan asked on Twitter if anyone wanted to create a campaign to donate to Syria.</p>

<p>“I just feel like we could make a difference and help a lot of people since we are so many from all around the world,” The user wrote.</p>

<p>And, of course, ARMY thought this was a great idea – but what if they didn’t make it just a one-time thing? </p>

<p>The idea of OIAA was created within a weekend, a fan collective comprised of volunteers across the globe, with a core team of 20 fans from 10 different countries. Each month, the organizers choose one non-profit organization and run a fundraiser for its cause. They wanted to focus on smaller organizations with tangible impacts, one that could handle microdonations. </p>

<br>

<iframe title="One In An Army" aria-label="map" id="datawrapper-chart-IvE5a" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IvE5a/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="359"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>


<p>Their motto, “I am ONE in an ARMY,” plays with the idea that many people giving small amounts can create a substantial impact when they work together, according to its website.</p>

<p>If a fan can’t donate, OIAA encourages them to use freerice, an ad-supported website where people can play games and earn grains of rice for the United Nations World Food.</p>

<p>“The fact that everyone should be able to join is very important to us, because everyone should feel like they are “One” in an ARMY,” The team said.</p>

<p>When choosing an organization to help, the OIAA tries to survey what the fandom is passionate for at the moment, organizing polls to narrow down causes. Usually, their campaign tallies fall under human needs, human rights, health and nature. But they also run fundraisers that are related to BTS and ARMY.</p>

<p>After choosing the cause they will be working with for the month, their research team look for organizations that tend to be small and offer tangible services.</p>

<p>“We just need to know exactly where ARMY’s money is going to be… as transparent as possible with our campaign material,” The organizers wrote on their website.</p>

<br>
<p>Many campaigns are also “birthday campaigns,” where fans donate to charity as gifts for each member of BTS. During those months, the organization also runs a bonus mission, encouraging fans to do volunteer work and donate for causes of their own choosing. </p>

<br>

<p>Their current campaign, Clowns Without Borders, will help the organization create public service announcements for children who witness or experience family abuse in Ecuador.</p>

<p>The name of the campaign is a perfect fit, the team said. Around the time of BTS pre-comeback, when fans were expecting news of the album to drop, they had a lot of “clown moments,” where they would just be wrong about something.</p>

<p>Although OIAA is a massive force within the fandom, the organizers are just fans, like everyone else, they say. They do it in their spare time.</p>

<p>“We do it because we love it, but also because we love this fandom and BTS,” They said. “We wanna help the best we can do to give back.”</p>



<p> But One In An Army is not the only fan organization that runs fundraisers and charity events in the name of BTS. Fanbases around the world organize their own projects. For years, the One In An Army has been tracking down ARMY's work, asking fanbases to send them a google form, with details of the charity and proof of donation. Now, they have compiled a map. </p>

<br>
<p>Initially, Nicole Santero, a doctorate student at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, didn’t understand why people would listen to K-Pop if they didn’t understand Korean. Though her boyfriend had been a casual fan of the group since 2013, when they debuted, Santero did not take an interest in their music until 2018, when they performed at the Billboard Music Awards. Then, she became intrigued. So, she asked her boyfriend to recommend music videos and songs. </p>

<p> “I fell down the rabbit hole and couldn’t get out of it,” She said with a laugh.

  <br>

<p>Now, Santero studies the culture, the social organizations and structures of ARMY as part of her doctorate degree. She has her own fan account, where she tries to understand what makes ARMY so impactful. </p>

<p>“Despite [ARMY] being incredibly large and a complex fandom made up of so many people around the world, they are impressively organized and collaborative,” Santero said. “They have these sets of systems and structures that are in place, that makes them really effective and really efficient at mobilizing.” </p>

<br>
<p>The fans of BTS are also empowered to believe that they play an important role in the fandom, Santero said, which helps them achieve their goals. It makes them strong and perfect activists and leaders for change. </p>
<p>“A lot of their passion and drive for doing this obviously comes from the fact that they themselves are even more empowered and inspired to do good because of BTS,” Santero said. </p>

<div id="caption">For Naazeen and Tagseen Samsodin, "We Are Bulletproof: The Eternal" encapsulates how connect ARMY and BTS are around the world.</div></center>
<br>
</div>

<p> Back in 2017, when Naazeen Samsodin would spend a lot of time in Tumblr, she would see BTS everywhere – but she had no idea who they were. At some point, enough was enough. She had to found who they were. </p>

<p> And then, after watching the “Blood Sweat and Tears” music video, she sent it to her sister, Tagseen Samsodin. </p>

<p> “Please check out this band, they are so good,” Naazeen told her sister.</p>

<p> Almost three years later, Tagseen and Naazeen, who are both 37, run a fanbase account for South Africa, their home country.</p>

<p> Compared to the United States and Europe, there aren’t as many BTS fans there, the sisters said. But they take part in the fandom’s culture of doing projects for members’ birthday, like a blood drive in December that about 100 fans attended. They do beach clean-ups and plant trees, and they have organized a project to donate care packs to children who had been sexually abused. All in their hometown, Cape Town. </p>

<p> Now that COVID-19 has hit the world, they partnered with Ladles of Love, a non-profit organization that feeds the underprivileged and the homeless, asking South African-based fans to donate. So far, they have raised over $300.</p>

<p> Before they were fans of BTS, the sisters didn’t go out of their way to do charity, they said. They didn’t plan projects, they didn’t think on how they could make a difference on their own community.</p>

<p> “[But] once you become ARMY, there’s something about seeing other people get involved in charitable things, make a difference, that makes you feel like you also want to make a difference, and almost pay that forward,” Naazeen said. “We've seen our fan base inspire other local fans to also get involved and start doing charitable things on a smaller scale but still trying to make a difference in their own community.” </p>

<center><img src="bts4.jpeg" alt="BTS_twt" minwidth="100%" width="800" height="600" class="center">
  <div id="caption">In the page's two-year anniversary, the sisters posted the highlights of their charity work.</div></center>

<p> But now, the sisters are constantly thinking about the next thing. They pay attention to what’s happening in South Africa that requires attention and come up with projects to shed light on the issues. </p>

<p> The fact that BTS members donate to causes close to their heart are particularly inspiring, especially since they don’t usually advertise it, the sisters said. </p>

<p>“When we see all of the members secretly donating to businesses and organizations that are important to them and close to their hearts, we think about ways in which we can emulate that in our home countries,” Tagseen said. “It’s a two-way street, you know. BTS inspires the fans via their own altruism, and, in return, fans show their love and support back to BTS by donating to charities that are important to us.” </p>

<p> But BTS’s work didn’t inspire the sisters only to give back to the world, but also to be more open. It made them question how they view the world. </p>

<p>“It makes us better people, to be able to inform ourselves and to have important conversations and to go, you know, ‘maybe the way I thought about things in the past wasn’t the best way,” Naazeen said. “But I’m proud of myself for taking that step and learning.” </p>

<br>
<br>
<p>In late 2017, BTS and its label Big Hit Entertainment started the LOVE MYSELF campaign with UNICEF, sponsoring a campaign called #ENDviolence.</p>

<p>Since then, they have raised over $2 million to protect and support child and teen victims of domestic and school violence and sexual assault, according to the campaign website. The funds will also be used to educate local communities for violence prevention. </p>

<p>“BTS has always been conscious of caring for the world. Ever since their debut in 2013, they have been focused on providing messages of comfort for young people,” The website reads. “They never hesitate to express social messages in songs as well as music videos. The member artists of BTS strive, in their own ways, to make the world a better place to live.”</p>

<p> But members of BTS are also known for their donations. Jin, one of the vocalists, joined UNICEF Korea's Honor Club in 2018, a group of donors where members must donate at least $88,000 to the organization's cause. </p>

<p> Other members, like RM, the leader and a rapper, donated over $80,000 to a school in Seoul that teaches hearing-impaired students.</p>
<p> Jimin, another vocalist from BTS, donated almost $90,000 to the his hometown's office of education. J-Hope, another rapper and the group's main dancer, donated over $130,000 to the Child Fund Korea. Suga, the group's third rapper, donated almost $90,000 to the Korea Pediatric Cancer Foundation. </p>
<p>In 2018, BTS attended a UNICEF event of the 73rd regular session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York as a representative of global youth. RM, the leader of BTS, delivered a speech that day, the first Korean singer to do so, where he talked about the LOVE MYSELF campaign.</p>
